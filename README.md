# Shark and School of Fish Simulation 🦈🐟

This project simulates the interaction between a **shark (predator)** and a **school of fish (prey)** in a 2D environment.  
It models **schooling behavior, predator avoidance, and pursuit dynamics** using numerical methods, visualization, and randomness.  

Developed as part of the **Master’s in Next-Level Engineering (MNLE) program**.  

---

## 🔹 Features
- Realistic **schooling fish** dynamics (attraction, spacing, randomness).  
- **Predator behavior** with pursuit, attack radius, and eating latency.  
- 2D simulation with **animated visualization** of predator–prey interactions.  
- Adjustable parameters: fish count, shark speed, attraction strength, randomness, etc.

## 🔹 Tech Stack & Libraries
- **Python**  
- **Numerical & AI libraries**: `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Torch`  
- **Visualization**: `Matplotlib`, `FuncAnimation`, `tqdm`  
- **Utilities**: `IPython.display` (for inline animations in Jupyter Notebooks)
  
Example Output
The animation shows:
🐟 Blue arrows → live fish schooling.
⚫ Black markers → dead fish.
🦈 Red/Orange arrows → shark (red = attacking, orange = searching)

Next Steps
Extend to multiple sharks and multiple schools of fish.
Explore emergent behaviors with varying parameters.
Apply reinforcement learning for predator/prey strategy optimization.
